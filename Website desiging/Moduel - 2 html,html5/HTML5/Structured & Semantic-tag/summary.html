Ned Armstrong Luke (born October 4, 1958) is an American actor. He is known for portraying Michael De Santa in the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V. Luke also voiced Raffles in the animated movie Rover Dangerfield. Personality. Michael is a very complex, quick-tempered and intelligent person, even confused by his "good and evil" personality. He has a darker and violent side to him. In GTA 5, Michael De Santa was 45 years old, which would place his birth year at 1968. However, Michael's tombstone states he was born in 1965, suggesting a discrepancy. This discrepancy could be due to Michael changing his identity and birthdate as part of his witness protection program. In 2025, Michael would be 57 years old. Amanda is Michael's wife, and mother of Jimmy and Tracy. Michael's power is known to only be matched by his brother Lucifer and surpassed only by God. His greatest power is the Demiurgic power that allows creation out of nothingness that is contained within him. Wielding it Michael was able to defeat his brother Lucifer and banish him from Heaven after his rebellion.</p>
