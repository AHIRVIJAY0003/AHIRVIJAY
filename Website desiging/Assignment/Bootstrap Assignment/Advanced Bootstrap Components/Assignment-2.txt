	-Bootstrap uses JavaScript to show and hide the modal smoothly.

=> Carousel Work

=> Utility classes in Bootstrap are predefined CSS helper classes that allow you to apply specific styles directly in your HTML elements without writing custom CSS.
They are used to quickly control layout, spacing, colors, alignment, visibility, and more — saving time and code.
Example:	
<div class="bg-primary text-white p-4 text-center rounded">
  This box has utility classes for background, text, padding, alignment, and rounded corners.
</div>.

Q3. Describe the importance of customizing bootstrap variable for unique elements.
