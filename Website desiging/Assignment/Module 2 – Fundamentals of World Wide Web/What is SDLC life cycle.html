<!-- What is SDLC life cycle?
-> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured, systematic process that guides software 
   development from initial planning through maintenance, ensuring high-quality, cost-effective, and timely 
   software delivery.
-> Definition  : SDLC is a framework that outlines the stages and tasks involved in creating and maintaining 
                  software. 
-> Purpose     : It aims to produce high-quality software that meets customer expectations, while also 
                  minimizing project risks through forward planning. 
-> Key Phases  : SDLC typically involves phases like planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, testing,
                  deployment, and maintenance. 
-> Benefits    : By following a structured SDLC, development teams can improve project tracking, reduce errors,
                  and ensure that software meets quality standards. 
-> Flexibility : While SDLC provides a framework, various methodologies like Agile, Waterfall, and Scrum can 
                  be used within it, offering flexibility to adapt to different project needs. 
-> Models      : There are different SDLC models, including the Waterfall model, Spiral model, and Agile model, 
                  each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
-> Importance  : SDLC is crucial for software development projects to ensure that they are well-planned,
                  executed, and maintained.
