<!-- What is hosting?
 -> Hosting, in the context of the internet, is the service of providing storage and access to websites or web applications on the internet,
    enabling users to access them through a web browser.

 * A more detailed explanation:

 -> What it is : Hosting involves storing all the files that make up a website (like images, text, code, etc.) on a server, which is a 
                 powerful computer that's always online and accessible via the internet.

 -> How it works : A web hosting provider maintains, configures, and runs these servers, and you can rent space on them to store your website's
                   files. 

 -> Why it's needed : Hosting makes your website accessible to users worldwide, as it provides the necessary infrastructure (servers, storage,
                      and technology) to keep your website live and running smoothly.

 -> Analogies : Think of it like renting an apartment (hosting) in a building (the internet) where the building owner (hosting provider)
                manages the building and ensures it's safe and accessible.

 -> Types of Hosting : There are different types of hosting, including shared hosting, VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting, and dedicated 
                       hosting, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. 

 -> Other services : Web hosting providers also offer additional services like server management, security measures, backups, and technical 
                  support, which free up your time so that you can focus on the core functions of your website.
