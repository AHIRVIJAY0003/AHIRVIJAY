<!-- What is a HTTP?
 -> HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web,enabling web browsers 
    and servers to exchange information. 

#  What it is:
-> HTTP is an application-layer protocol, meaning it sits on top of other network protocols like TCP/IP, defining how web servers and clients 
   (like web browsers) communicate. 

#  How it works:
-> When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which then responds with an HTTP response containing the 
   requested web page or other content.
